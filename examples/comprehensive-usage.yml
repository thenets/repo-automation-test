# =============================================================================
# MIGRATION NOTES & SUCCESS STORY
# =============================================================================

# 🎉 SUCCESSFUL MIGRATION EXAMPLE:
# The thenets/repo-automation repository completed migration in December 2024:
#
# BEFORE (4 individual workflows - 1,635 lines):
#   - keeper-triage.yml (339 lines) 
#   - keeper-stale-pr-detector.yml (235 lines)
#   - keeper-auto-label-release-backport.yml (442 lines)
#   - keeper-feature-branch-auto-labeling.yml (456 lines)
#   - keeper-trigger.yml (163 lines) - PRESERVED for fork compatibility
#
# AFTER (1 unified workflow - 79 lines):
#   - repository-automation.yml (79 lines using this action)
#   - keeper-trigger.yml (163 lines) - PRESERVED for fork compatibility
#   - test-triage-action.yml (enhanced testing)
#
# RESULT: 95% code reduction + simplified maintenance + enhanced testing

# When migrating YOUR repository from individual keeper workflows:
# 
# 1. REPLACE these files with the examples above:
#    - .github/workflows/keeper-triage.yml
#    - .github/workflows/keeper-stale-pr-detector.yml  
#    - .github/workflows/keeper-auto-label-release-backport.yml
#    - .github/workflows/keeper-feature-branch-auto-labeling.yml
# 
# 2. KEEP this file for fork compatibility:
#    - .github/workflows/keeper-trigger.yml
# 
# 3. UPDATE repository references:
#    - Replace 'your-org/your-repo' with your actual repository name
# 
# 4. CONFIGURE secrets:
#    - CUSTOM_GITHUB_TOKEN: Fine-grained personal access token for external contributors
#    - Required permissions: Issues (Write), Pull Requests (Write), Metadata (Read)
# 
# 5. CREATE required labels in repository settings:
#    - 'triage' (for new issues/PRs)
#    - 'ready for review' (for PRs with release labels)
#    - 'stale' (for inactive PRs)
#    - 'feature-branch' (for feature branch requests)
# 
# 6. TEST the setup:
#    - Use dry-run: true initially
#    - Verify outputs and behavior
#    - Test with external contributor PRs
#
# 7. REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION:
#    - Check thenets/repo-automation repository for a working example
#    - See repository-automation.yml for complete configuration

# =============================================================================
# YAML FRONTMATTER EXAMPLES (For Auto-Labeling Features)
# =============================================================================

# When the auto-labeling features are available, add YAML frontmatter to PR descriptions:
# 
# ```yaml
# release: 2.1          # Valid values from accepted-releases
# backport: 2.0         # Valid values from accepted-backports  
# needs_feature_branch: true   # Boolean: true/false
# ```
# 
# Example PR description:
# ```
# ## Description
# This PR adds a new feature for user authentication.
# 
# ```yaml
# release: devel
# needs_feature_branch: true
# ```
# 
# ## Changes
# - Added login functionality
# - Updated documentation
# ```

# =============================================================================
# TROUBLESHOOTING
# =============================================================================

# Common issues and solutions:
# 
# 1. Permission Denied Errors:
#    - Ensure CUSTOM_GITHUB_TOKEN has correct permissions
#    - Check repository settings allow Actions to write to issues/PRs
# 
# 2. Fork Compatibility Issues:
#    - Verify keeper-trigger.yml is present and correctly configured
#    - Check workflow_run triggers are properly set up
# 
# 3. Labels Not Being Added:
#    - Ensure required labels exist in repository settings
#    - Check if labels already exist on issues/PRs
#    - Verify token permissions
# 
# 4. Stale Detection Not Working:
#    - Check schedule syntax and timezone (UTC)
#    - Verify stale-days configuration
#    - Ensure repository condition matches actual repository name
# 
# 5. YAML Validation Errors:
#    - Check YAML frontmatter syntax in PR descriptions
#    - Verify release/backport values are in accepted lists
#    - Look for check run results and comments for detailed errors
